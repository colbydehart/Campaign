# Campaign
A windows application for keeping track of D&amp;D campaigns

This is a windows app for writing and keeping track of D&D campaigns. Campaigns are meant to be non-linear with many
different routes and paths adventurers can take. Writing campaigns down on just paper or a text editor isn't 
optimal for non-linear stories and while running the game, it's hard to keep track of where the players are when 
you have one monolithic text document of storyline.

Campaign makes this composition easier. You make a campaign with multiple adventures. Each adventure is composed 
of a series of related *panels*. A panel represents one place or activity the party could go to. The center of 
a town, a room in a dungeon, or a split in a path. Each panel can have multiple children panels (decisions the
party must make) and parent panels can both lead up to one child (like all roads lead to some town). This way, 
you can write non-linear stories, and when you run your game, you can see only what is relevant based on the 
characters' choices.
